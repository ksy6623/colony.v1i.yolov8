The dataset includes 1592 images.
Colony are annotated in YOLOv8 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 100x100 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* Random Gaussian blur of between 0 and 2.5 pixels
